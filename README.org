#+TITLE: QuantumChess
#+AUTHOR: Cody Lewis
This is a python implementation of quantum chess using IBM's Qiskit for the
case of piece superposition. That is, to calculate the probability of the
entire pieces death. Sadly, the game runs for too long to have entanglement
of the qubits.
The web server side was intended to only be a graphical frontend to the program,
thus is a bit inefficient as a web app, and on heroku the backend sometimes gets
reset, so the frontend no longer matchs the backend.

** Requirements
- flask
- qiskit
- bleach
- gunicorn

** Installing
Get python, then run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pip install flask qiskit bleach gunicorn
#+END_SRC

** Running
From this root execute:

*** Web Version
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gunicorn wsgi --log-file -
#+END_SRC

*** Command Line version
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd cmd/
python play.py
