Quantum Chess by Cody Lewis
Last Modified: 12-APR-2018

This is a python implementation of quantum chess using IBM's Qiskit for the
case of piece superposition. That is, to calculate the probability of the
entire pieces death. Sadly, the game runs for too long to have entanglement
of the qubits.

Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- qiskit
- Flask
- bleach
